									<h2>The Newest and Cleanest Way to Harness Earthâ€™s Energy: Waves</h2>
									<p> Global warming is quickly becoming one of the biggest problems our society faces today. The transition from non-renewable energy sources to renewable energy sources is fascinating. I wanted to learn more about the process and explore an energy source that is often looked over. This blog post allows me to share my findings. </p>

						<h2>Group Projects</h2>
						<p>I was part of the group, Classroom Appropriate, where we explored concepts of future technology by making both a podcast and a short video. These types of medias allowed us to have in depth conversations about future technology, while allowing us to get creative and gain experience in scripting and editing audio and video.</p>

						<h2>Charity</h2>
						<p>The main goal of our group was to raise awareness on what the future holds in terms of technology, both good and bad. What better way is there to teach youth about technology than giving them direct access to it?</p>
